General Information:


At a minimum, you will need to answer three of the following business questions:
1. What is the expected selling price of my home?
2. What factors influence the price of my home?
3. Which factors are more important than others?
4. How much should I invest in improving the condition of my home in order to
increase the expected price by more than the cost of improvements?
5. Which homes should I compare my house to?
